SYNOPSIS

        RNAmotifAnalysis --fastq seqs.fq --cpus 4 --run

DESCRIPTION

        This module pipelines steps in the analysis of SELEX (Systematic Evolution
        of Ligands through EXponential enrichment) data.
    
        This main module creates scripts to do the following:
    
        (1) Cluster similar sequences based on edit distance.
    
        (2) Align sequences within each cluster (using mafft).
    
        (3) Calculate the secondary structure of the aligned sequences (using
            RNAalifold, from the Vienna RNA package)
    
        (4) Build covariance models using cmbuild from Infernal.
    
        Another useful utility installed with this distribution is
        "selex_covarianceSearch" for doing iterative refinements of
        covariance models.
    
        If you want to use files that simply list sequences, then use
        the "--simple" flag instead of the "--fastq" flag.
    
        This script assumes that you've already done all of the quality
        control of your sequences beforehand. If the FASTQ format is
        used, quality scores are ignored.

EXAMPLE USE

        RNAmotifAnalysis --infile seqs.fq --cpus 4 --run
    
        This will cluster the sequences found in 'seqs.fq' and create a FASTA file
        for each one. The FASTA files will be grouped into batches (i.e. one per
        cpu requested) that will be placed in a separate directory for each batch,
        and processed within that directory. At the end of processing, for each
        cluster there will be a covariance model and postscript illustration
        files. The batch script used to process each batch will be located in the
        respective batch directory.  To produce the scripts without running them,
        simply exclude the --run flag from the command line.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

        As written, this code makes heavy use of UNIX utilities and is
        therefore only supported on UNIX-like environemnts (e.g. Linux, UNIX, Mac
        OS X).
    
        Install Infernal, MAFFT, and the RNA Vienna package ahead of time and add
        the directories containing their executables to your PATH, so that the
        first time you run RNAmotifAnalysis.pm the configuration file (cluster.cfg)
        that is generated will have all of the correct parameters. Otherwise,
        you'll need to update the configuration file manually.
    
        To update the PATH environment variable with the directory '/usr/local/myapps/bin/',
        update your .bashrc file, thus:
    
            echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/myapps/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc.
    
        Now, every time you open a new terminal window, the PATH environment
        variable will contain '/usr/local/myapps/bin/'. To make your new .bashrc
        file effective immediately (i.e. without having to open a new terminal
        window), use the following command:
    
            source ~/.bashrc

INSTALLATION

        These installation instructions assume being able to open and use a
        terminal window on Linux.
    
        (0) Some systems need several dependencies installed ahead of time.
    
            You may be able to skip this step. However, if subsequent steps don't
            work, then be sure that some basic libraries are installed, as shown
            below (or ask a system administrator to take care of it). For the
            applicable distribution, open a terminal and then type the commands as
            indicated:
    
            For RedHat or CentOS 5.x systems (tested on CentOS 5.5)
    
                    sudo yum install gcc
    
            For RedHat or CentOS 6.x systems (tested on "Minimal Desktop" CentOS 6.0)
    
                    sudo yum install gcc
                    sudo yum install perl-devel
    
            For Ubuntu systems (tested on Ubuntu 12-04 LTS)
    
                    sudo apt-get install curl
    
            For Debian 5.x systems:
    
                    sudo apt-get install gcc
                    sudo apt-get install make
    
        (1) Install the non-Perl dependencies:
            (Versions shown are those that we've tested. Please contact us if
            newer versions do not work.)
    
            Infernal            1.0.2    (http://infernal.janelia.org/)
            MAFFT               6.849b   (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)
            RNA Vienna package  1.8.4    (http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/)
    
            After installing these, make sure all of the foloowing executables are
            in directories within your PATH:
    
                cmbuild
                cmcalibrate
                cmsearch
                cmalign
                mafft
                RNAalifold
    
        (2) Either (a) download and run our installer or (b) use a CPAN client
            to install Bio::App::SELEX::RNAmotifAnalysis.
    
    
            (a) Installation method: Use the installer. 
    
                  i. Download installer (and name it "installer")
    
                        curl -o installer -L http://ircf.rnet.missouri.edu:8000/share.attachment/200
    
    
                 ii. Make it executable
    
                        chmod u+x installer
    
    
                iii. Run it.
    
                        ./installer
    
                 iv. Delete it if everything installed okay.
    
                        rm installer
    
                NOTE: Our installer creates the directory 'perl5' inside your home
                directory. This directory serves as the top directory for Perl
                modules and executables installed at this time, including
                dependencies of the installed modules. The installer also appends
                commands to your .bashrc file to make the installed programs
                runnable by default (i.e. it includes your local 'perl5/lib/perl5'
                directory in the PERL5LIB environment variable and your local
                'perl5/bin' directory in your PATH environment variable).
    
    
            (b) Installation method: Use a CPAN client. Here we demonstrate
                the use of cpanminus to install it to a local Perl module
                directory. These instructions assume absolutely no experience
                with cpanminus.
    
                  i. Download cpanminus
    
                        curl -LOk http://xrl.us/cpanm
    
    
                 ii. Make it executable
    
                        chmod u+x cpanm
    
    
                iii. Make a local perl5 directory (if it doesn't already exist)
    
                        mkdir -p ~/perl5
    
    
                 iv. Add relevant directories to your PERL5LIB and PATH environment
                     variables by adding the following text to your ~/.bashrc
                     file:
    
    
                        # Set PERL5LIB if it doesn't already exist
                        : ${PERL5LIB:=~/perl5/lib/perl5}
    
                        # Prepend to PERL5LIB if directory not already found in PERL5LIB
                        if ! echo $PERL5LIB | egrep -q "(^|:)~/perl5/lib/perl5($|:)"; then
                            export PERL5LIB=~/perl5/lib/perl5:$PERL5LIB;
                        fi
    
                        # Prepend to PATH if directory not already found in PATH
                        if ! echo $PATH | egrep -q "(^|:)~/perl5/bin($|:)"; then
                            export PATH=~/perl5/bin:$PATH;
                        fi
    
    
                  v. Update environment variables immediately
    
                        source ~/.bashrc
    
    
                 vi. Install Module::Build
    
                        ./cpanm -l ~/perl5 Module::Build
    
    
                vii. Install Bio::App::SELEX::RNAmotifAnalysis
    
                        ./cpanm -l ~/perl5 Bio::App::SELEX::RNAmotifAnalysis
    
    
        Please contact the author if, after consulting this documentation and
        searching Google with error messages, you still encounter difficulties
        during the installation process using one of these two methods.
