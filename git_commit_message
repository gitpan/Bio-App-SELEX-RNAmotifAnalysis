New Feature:
Sequence identifier now has edit distance from cluster reference sequence included as a fourth number in the identifier (e.g. for the identifier 2.3.1.5, the corresponding sequence has an edit distance of 5 from the reference sequence). 

Bug Fixes:
Fixed bug that would prevent sequences from being added to a cluster after the maximum number of clusters had been found.
Removed spurious dependency on Getopt::Long::Descriptive
